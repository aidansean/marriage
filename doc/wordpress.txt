This project was the first step in a larger project that scrubbed data from pages for analysis.

<h3>Overview</h3>

This page takes input from Wikipedia (although at the moment this is extracted manually from the main page) and then produces a C script which summarises the data for further analysis.  ROOT is then used to make a plot showing the data.  The idea behind the project was to make data scrubbing easier and to give me practice in data scrubbing.  If I ever get sufficient time I intend to create some resources to make data scrubbing easier and make sharing of publically accessible data simpler.  The the data are taken from an outdated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Age_at_first_marriage&oldid=573979725">Wikiepdia page</a> which is missing many sources.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Challenge</em>: The data needs to be scrubbed from the page easily.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: To save time I manually copied the data from Wikipedia for offline analysis, but this should be fixed to read the data online. (Resolved, to be revisited)</dd>
<dt><em>Challenge</em>: The output needs to be some kind of source file, for example C or python.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: The source file I chose was a ROOT macro for convenience.  Ideally the user should be able to choose what output they want (including xml) to best suit their needs. (Resolved, to be revisited)</dd>
